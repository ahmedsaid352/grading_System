# grading_System
•	The system should read a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file which stores the data for four variables: student’s ID, name, midterm_grade, and classwok_grade.  
•	The first raw of the file contains the variable names. 
•	When the system starts, it should show a welcome screen, then it shows the menu of options.
•	The menu of options should include the following tasks:
1.	Show Data: To show the content of the data file to the user (in a nice and readable way).
2.	Count the number of students included in your data file and show count.
3.	Compute final score: in a separate column show student’s final score (midterm_grade+classwork_grade)
4.	Compute and Show Grades: the system should compute and print student’s ID, name and grade for each student according to the following rule: 
a.	A: for 100>=score >=90
b.	B: for 90> score>=75
c.	C: for 75> score>=60
d.	D: for 60> score>=50
e.	F: for 50> 
5.	Column Statistics: To calculate and show the following statistics for the Score column:
a.	The minimum and maximum score
b.	The average, standard deviation, and variance of score. 
6.	Show students of grade A 
7.	Search by Name:  the system should ask for student’s name or part of the name, then it prints the data for all students with names containing the given name/part.
8.	Exit: to print a good-bye message and exit the system.
